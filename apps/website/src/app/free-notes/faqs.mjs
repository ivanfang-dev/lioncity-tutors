    question: 'Which subjects do the free study notes cover?',
    answer:
      'A-Level General Paper, in the form of five Raffles Institution 2024 infopacks: media issues, science and technology, social issues, arts and culture, and politics. Other subjects show as "Coming soon" until real notes exist for them — nothing on this page is a placeholder download.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you use a General Paper infopack to revise?',
    answer:
      'Read one theme at a time and pull out three things: a recent example with a date, a counter-argument, and a phrase you could reuse in an essay. Infopacks are raw material, not model answers, so the value comes from turning each theme into your own bank of examples before the exam.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are the free notes really free to download?',
    answer:
      'Yes. There is no payment and no account to create: you enter an email address and a contact number, and the file opens in a new tab. We use those details to send new notes and study resources, and parents who go on to request a tutor never pay an agency fee.',
  },
